# Getting Started

## What is React Just?

React Just is the simplest way to use React with React Server Components (Server Components and Server Functions).

## Pre-requisite knowledge

This documentation assumes you're somewhat familiar with React, [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) and [Server Functions](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions).

## Try It Out Online

You can try the JavaScript version below, but we recommend opening it in a separate tab via the [JavaScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/almadoro/react-just/tree/main/templates/node-js?file=src%2Findex.jsx&startScript=dev) or [TypeScript](https://stackblitz.com/github/almadoro/react-just/tree/main/templates/node-ts?file=src%2Findex.tsx&startScript=dev) links.

::: warning `start` command
The `start` command may not work on StackBlitz, but it works correctly on a Node.js environment.

## Why React Just?

React Server Components are a specification designed for full-stack React frameworks. Frameworks like **Next.js** and **React Router** implement this specification, but they also add additional features and conventions that often make using **full-stack React more complex than it needs to be**.

**React Just takes a different approach**: it focuses only on the RSC specification. No opinions, no extra conventions, no hidden features, just React Server Components in the simplest possible form. This keeps applications **easy to understand, easy to mantain and easy to deploy anywhere**.
