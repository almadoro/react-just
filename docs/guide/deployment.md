# Deployment

React Just is platform-agnostic, meaning it can be deployed to any environment that supports running JavaScript in some form.

## Choose Your Deployment Platform

You can use prebuilt platform packages to deploy your app with minimal configuration, or [create your own](/platforms/custom.md). The following platforms are currently available or planned:

| Platform   | Status                       | Package                                      |
